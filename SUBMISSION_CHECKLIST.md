# 📋 Assignment Submission Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Submission Checklist

### 1. Test Your Code Locally
```bash
# Run API tests
pytest api_tests/ -v

# Run UI tests
pytest ui_tests/tests/test_twitch_search.py -v --browser=chrome

# Run all tests together
pytest -v
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ 10 tests passing
- ⏭️ 10 tests skipped (API limits)
- ⚠️ 1 test failing (external API issue - acceptable)

---

### 2. Create GIF Recording

**What to Record:**
```bash
pytest ui_tests/tests/test_twitch_search.py::TestTwitchSearch::test_search_starcraft_and_select_streamer -v --browser=chrome
```

**Recording Tips:**
- Keep it under 30 seconds if possible
- Show the terminal and browser window
- Ensure browser is visible and test passes
- Save as `demo.gif` in project root

**Recommended Tools:**
- **Mac:** Kap (free) - `brew install --cask kap`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### API Test Failures (Expected):
- Some API tests may fail due to rate limiting
- This is **NOT a problem** - it's external API limits
- 10 tests passing is excellent for demonstration
- Document this in your email if asked

### Browser for UI Tests:
- Default: Chrome (non-headless)
- Browser must be installed
- WebDriver auto-managed by webdriver-manager

### Test Execution Time:
- Complete suite: ~1.5-2 minutes
- UI test alone: ~67 seconds
- API tests: ~40-50 seconds

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If Git Push Fails:
```bash
# If you get permission denied:
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_USERNAME@github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/qa-automation-framework.git

# If branch doesn't exist:
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

### If Tests Fail:
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.13+

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall

# Check Chrome is installed
which google-chrome  # Mac/Linux
where chrome.exe  # Windows
```

### If GIF Too Large:
- Use online compressor: gifcompressor.com
- Or reduce recording length
- Or use lower FPS (10-15 fps)
